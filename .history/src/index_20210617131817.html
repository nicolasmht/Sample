                <p>Concrete music</p>
                <p>Experimental technique of musical composition using recorded sounds as raw material. The technique was developed about 1948 by the French composer Pierre Schaeffer and his associates at the Studio d’Essai (“Experimental Studio”) of the French radio system. The fundamental principle of musique concrète lies in the assemblage of various natural sounds recorded on tape (or, originally, on disks) to produce a montage of sound. During the preparation of such a composition, the sounds selected and recorded may be modified in any way desired—played backward, cut short or extended, subjected to echo-chamber effects, varied in pitch and intensity, and so on. The finished composition thus represents the combination of varied auditory experiences into an artistic unity.</p>

                <p>tape looping</p>
                <p>In music, tape loops are loops of magnetic tape used to create repetitive, rhythmic musical patterns or dense layers of sound when played on a tape recorder. Originating in the 1940s with the work of Pierre Schaeffer, they were used among contemporary composers of 1950s and 1960s, such as Éliane Radigue, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and Karlheinz Stockhausen, who used them to create phase patterns, rhythms, textures, and timbres. Popular music authors of 1960s and 1970s, particularly in psychedelic, progressive and ambient genres, used tape loops to accompany their music with innovative sound effects. In the 1980s, analog audio and tape loops with it gave way to digital audio and application of computers to generate and process sound.

                _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

                'The tape loop idea started because they all had Brennell machines,'
                - Geoff Emerick sound engineer & record producer of the Beatles

                'Paul in particular used the make his own loops at home and walk into the studio with bags full of little reels saying "Listen to this!" The seagull-like noise on "Tomorrow Never Knows" is realy a distorted guitar.'  'We did a live mix of all the loops'
                - George Martin record producer, arranger, composer, conductor, audio engineer, and musician

                'All over the studios we had people spooling them onto machines with pencils while Geoff did the balancing. There were many other hands controlling the panning.' 'We had five machines running,' 
                - Phil McDonald recording studio audio engineer of the Beatles

                'Geoff would say "OK, let's lift that fader, that sounds good." It was done totally off the cuff. The control room was as full of loops as it was people.' 'I laid all of the loops onto the multi-track and played the faders like a modern day synthesiser,'
                - Geoff Emerick sound engineer & record producer of the Beatles
